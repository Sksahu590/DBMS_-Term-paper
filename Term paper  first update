\section*{Abstract}
When visiting a new place for the first time or going to an event one must often deal with finding a car parking space. This can be a challenging and frustrating task for a number of reasons. In most cases, the location of parking spots is not known beforehand. Even if it is known, the parking location is not ideally suited (might not be the closest or cheapest). Furthermore, if one is visiting a location for some event, one must try to find a parking space amongst the limited parking spaces that are available at events attended by a large group of people. Parking spaces can also have restrictions attached to them. Some parking lots are available only during certain hours of the day or they may only allow parking by people with permits. To help navigate through all these issues. Software used for the parking management system is MySQL. MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL). A database is a structured collection of data.
